Timetable solution for a real-world instance based on the MAX-MIN Ant System and Local Search
The best solution created by the ants after a time limit is published in an Excel file.
The instance is based on Covenant University's timetable instance for the 2013â€“2015 period. Some new demands have been required of an automated solution since then.
Navigate to the "...\bin\Debug" folder and create an empty Excel file called "Timetable.xlsx" before you run the program for the first time.

The solution was implemented in 2015 as an MSc. project!
